      <p>I am a lover of all things beautiful. Images, words, sounds, ideas. With that inspiration, I create. The seed for my creative spirit was planted when I was eight years old, watching my grandfather transform a blank canvas into a landscape. As I watched the canvas fill with grass, flowers and cattle, I realized that beautiful things weren’t just meant to be passively observed; I could create them as well.</p><br>
      <p>I was hooked instantly, and I’ve never looked back, moving from paper and pencil to mouse and monitor. I expanded into coding and programming so I could provide my clients with a more well-rounded offering of services.
      My design aesthetic is about crisp lines and sharp colors – in short, it’s klean. Each client represents the opportunity for mutual growth and inspiration. Life never ceases to surprise me, and I find that being open and collaborative is the best way to serve my clients.</p><br>
      <p>Outside of designing and coding, I am a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/wordplay-Lloyd-Owens/dp/130005753X" target="_blank">poet</a>, retired spoken word artist, and sneaker fanatic, I have an unhealthy affinity for Diet Dr. Pepper, and Pretty Woman is one of my favorite movies. As you can see, I don't really fit inside any boxes; my versatility and communication skills are what set me apart. That, and the fact that I get to nurture my creative spirit by rediscovering the world through the eyes of my two amazing sons, Jah, Zion and their little princess of a sister Zoe.</p>
